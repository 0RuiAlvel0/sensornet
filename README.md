Open source arduino code designed to operate with comma CMMS API and generate equipment work requests automatically based on actual field conditions

# How do I get this working?

1. Get an arduino controller board <a href="http://store.arduino.cc/product/A000066">from here</a>.
2. Get an arduino ethernet shield (we developed the original code for the wired variant, but please feel free to fork and commit the code for a wireless variant <a href="http://store.arduino.cc/product/A000058">with this hardware</a>).
3. Download the arduino IDE <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software">here</a>.

The current code was developed for the VERY old arduino duemillenove, and we would love users to edit the code to make it work for the latest versions.
